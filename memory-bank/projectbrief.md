# Project Brief: OLMoCR

## Overview
OLMoCR (Optical Layout Model for Content Recognition) is a Python-based system for processing and analyzing PDF documents with advanced OCR capabilities. The project appears to focus on document understanding, particularly for scientific and technical documents.

## Core Requirements
1. PDF processing pipeline
2. OCR quality assessment
3. Document layout analysis
4. Content filtering and classification
5. Benchmarking and evaluation framework

## Key Goals
- Process complex PDF documents with mixed content (text, tables, equations)
- Identify and handle common PDF issues (bad OCR, multi-column layouts, etc.)
- Provide quality metrics for document processing
- Support training/evaluation of document understanding models

## Scope Boundaries
- Primarily focused on scientific/technical documents
- Includes both modern and scanned/legacy documents
- Supports integration with various OCR backends
