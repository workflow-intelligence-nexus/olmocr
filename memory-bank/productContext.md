- Poor text extraction quality
- Loss of structural information
- Difficulty in downstream processing

## Solution Approach
OLMoCR provides:
1. Advanced layout analysis
2. Specialized handling for scientific content
3. Quality assessment metrics
4. Filtering mechanisms for problematic documents

## Key User Workflows
1. **Document Processing**:
   - PDF ingestion
   - Layout analysis
   - Content extraction
   - Quality scoring

2. **Benchmarking**:
   - Performance evaluation
   - Comparison between different processing methods
   - Generation of test sets

3. **Training**:
   - Dataset preparation
   - Model training pipelines
   - Inference capabilities

## Target Users
- Researchers processing scientific literature
- Digital archivists
- Machine learning engineers working with document data
- Technical writers/publishers
