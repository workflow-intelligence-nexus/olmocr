# Project Progress: OLMoCR

## Current Status
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - PDF processing pipeline operational
   - Basic layout analysis implemented
   - Quality metrics system in place

2. **Completed Features**:
   - Document ingestion and preprocessing
   - Basic text extraction
   - Initial quality scoring
   - Test framework established
   - FastAPI integration with async process_pdf_file_async()
   - Proper A6000 GPU configuration for HTTP service
   - Docker containerization for Windows 11 deployment
   - WSL2 integration for cross-platform compatibility

3. **In Progress**:
   - Advanced layout analysis
   - Enhanced filtering mechanisms
   - Benchmarking framework expansion

## Known Issues
1. **Technical Limitations**:
   - Some complex PDF layouts still problematic
   - Performance bottlenecks with large documents
   - Edge cases in quality scoring
   - ~~Event loop conflicts in FastAPI integration~~ (Fixed)
   - ~~NumPy version conflicts in Docker container~~ (Fixed with version pinning)

2. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Need more examples in documentation
   - Some internal APIs not fully documented
   - Could improve contributor guidelines

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Priorities**:
   - Improve multi-column handling
   - Enhance mathematical content processing
   - Expand test coverage

2. **Future Roadmap**:
   - Add support for additional document types
   - Improve training pipelines
   - Develop more sophisticated quality metrics

## Evolution Notes
1. **Key Decisions**:
   - Chose modular pipeline architecture
   - Standardized on PyTorch for ML components
   - Implemented comprehensive testing early

2. **Lessons Learned**:
   - Complex PDFs require flexible processing
   - Quality metrics need careful calibration
   - Performance optimization is ongoing
   - Async/sync context management is critical for FastAPI integration
   - Specific GPU configuration is essential for consistent performance
   - Docker containerization requires careful dependency management
   - Cross-platform compatibility needs explicit environment detection
