## **The 20 Most Important Mathematical Equations**

A journey through the most elegant and influential formulas in mathematics

**1. Euler's Identity** Connects five fundamental constants (e, i, π, 1, 0), revealing the profound relationship between exponential functions and trigonometry. **3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** Establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. If F is an antiderivative of f, the definite integral equals F(b) - F(a). Revolutionized mathematical problem-solving. **2. Pythagorean Theorem 4. Maxwell's Equations** *e* + *iπ* 1 = 0 ∫ *f*(*x*) *dx* = *a b F*(*b*) − *F*(*a*) *a* + <sup>2</sup> *b* = <sup>2</sup> *c* <sup>2</sup> <sup>∇</sup> <sup>⋅</sup> **<sup>E</sup>** <sup>=</sup> *ρ*

In right triangles, the hypotenuse squared equals the sum of the squares of the other sides. Cornerstone of geometry with applications in navigation and architecture.

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon\_0}
$$

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu\_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu\_0 \varepsilon\_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}
