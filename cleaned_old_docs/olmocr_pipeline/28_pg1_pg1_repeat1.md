Dorchester, Mass., May 22nd., 1914.

Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay.

Dear sir:â€”

The blind gropings of our legislators and men in places of authority to secure an entering wedge for the reduction of the cost of living and remedy existing conditions with relation to monopoly are a joke to some of the workers who are on the inside.

I know and have full and complete knowledge of the key to the gradual destruction of all food and provision combinations, including all trusts and combinations of bankers, which will invariably be found to exist only by unfair methods of competition, and the elimination of control of legislation by capital. The use of this key will gain its author, or sponsor, grateful memory by the common people for a hundred years.

Will you make this a campaign issue and the fight of your life with all the forces of capital arrayed against you, but, with the labor organizations and the common people with you?

Address me at 81 Bernard St. Very Respectfully,

C.A. Eaton.
