Boston, Jan. 18th, 52

My dear Sir,

After presenting to you my best respects - I beg to say that I have mailed to your address a copy of a letter to Hon. Peter Cooper, of New York, on the subject of the Union.

I was advised to publish this letter by some of our leading men here - who saw the manuscript - so that it might be distributed to strengthen the Union sentiment. I shall be glad to know your views of its merit, so that it may be made known & scattered if calculated to do good. Remain with great respect Your sent friend

Hon. Jos. Holt, Washington, D.C.
