Note.—The Branches of this Bank at Bowling Green, Hopkinsville, and Columbus, have been for several months within the lines occupied by the army of the Southern Confederacy. We have no satisfactory report of the condition of their Assets, and correspondence with Southern cities being suspended, we are unable to give a satisfactory report of the condition of the paper placed in Southern Banks for collection.
