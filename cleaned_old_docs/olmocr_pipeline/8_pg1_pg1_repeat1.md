That can prove you it and from which you can imagine and convince yourself of the truth of my words. My first son who is attending a Public School at Bay Side in Long Island is ranked in your honor.

In closing this letter, I really hope and wish from the dept of my heart that some day I shall have the greatest honor of seeing you and saying to you one word in a line of since. I remain

your humble servant

C. O. Belmonte

P.S. I would highly appreciate if you would send me your picture.
