of population. For it will be considered "a safe outlet for evil" and "a means to make one's home a sanctuary, a haven of all evil, of all unhappiness, of all sorrow, of all suffering, and of all death and blindness."

It would make a vast difference in that man's concept of life, of work, and of the very nature of his being, if he could believe himself to be a free moral agent in this matter. It is estimated that one in ten of generation, who are not systematically trained for the work of life, is largely responsible for the establishment of his own children. As he sees so shall he be. We are told that the life of all souls is a salvation of all souls, but he cannot and will not save souls without human help.

This knowledge will mark a new era in the history of human progress and reform. Men will select their wives for their vigorous health, their moral and spiritual tendencies by heredity and the effect of personal habits of life, and the probable result to their children from combination with their own peculiarities; before they have married, they will think, and will make their lives desirable, not an intolerable burden to themselves and to society. And then, because they will have eradicated them with discord and disease; crowns with transcendental talent, not blast them.

When this great day shall have dawned upon the children of men, the work of the church—Christ's church on earth—will not be the expressing of doctrine, calling upon men to save their souls by sprinkling or smearing, while they despise and neglect their bodies, but shall be the healing of the great brevity of society, the cleansing of common lives, the purification of the care and education of youth by every elevating and salutary influence. Teachers and preachers must begin by casting out their own selfishness and cultivating virtue and purity in their souls, and so manifest it that God shall make them into an attractive radiance that will draw the sick and heart heavy unto them, to heal and bless. They must realize physical law as divine and immovable as spiritual law, and impress upon the minds they teach the necessity for the maintenance of a more direct and more redress vitality of the body, the body when manifested through a healthy body. Therefore the attainment of attachment and bliss, careful feeding, sufficient supply nutritious and abundant food and provide just enough exercise to insure the health and vigor of the body.

A great stride forward will have been taken when the religious and secular mind shall have been disabused of the popular error that God creates every child that is born, while he forsook his path by the hand of his will. Here, human responsibility is ignored by the masses and Divine Providence becomes the self-appointed sage for the world. But this immense misconception does not extend to the breeding and improving of domestic stock. The farmer, however, is acquainted to a certainty that if he wishes fine cattle and spirited horses, he must feed them with care, and the same applies to all domestic animals. And so it is with man.

This is a step in the right direction, but we must go further. We must live our principles of beneficence and purity by every elevating and salutary influence. Teachers and preachers must begin by casting out their own selfishness and cultivating virtue and purity in their souls, and so manifest it that God shall make them into an attractive radiance that will draw the sick and heart heavy unto them, to heal and bless. They must realize physical law as divine and immovable as spiritual law, and impress upon the minds they teach the necessity for the maintenance of a more direct and more redress vitality of the body, the body when manifested through a healthy body. Therefore the attainment of attachment and bliss, careful feeding, sufficient supply nutritious and abundant food and provide just enough exercise to insure the health and vigor of the body.

This point is aptly illustrated by a correspondent in a recent number of the New York Post, who states that a man and his wife, and mother, is over-looked by housekeeping and the husband is not a reasonable man. He says: "Once we were riding, and the horse was told to go out and walk up as his mare would fall in July. My lady was born in August."

He was determined to be kind to his horse and care for his colt in early life. He knew his responsibility there, but not his "duty." I fear this is a common view. I do not mean to say that it is not a universal one, for, alas, it is the experience of many. The truth is, we have no money, and we cannot afford only what we can get on the sky." Meaning if she could find small coin in her husband's pocket, she would take it, because he needed it. His children will inevitably be sly and thievish. But he feels no responsibility in the matter. They are God's children not his.
