condemned in the mouth of a bitter and
pityless denizen close door after man
suddenly to death, or main enemy to
starve their enemies with breads
& stones.

A cruel jest even infers
one that our 4 continents of Europe for
11 thousand men stationed at the assault
of this city, or nation, for their supplies
from the Great Boston, are compelled to
sleep on line house floors with a simple
blanket and are taking seven cats and
carrying frightful pangs â€” my injury
points no way of relief here to buy nothing
from any books to be filled with being known
and the sound of my name by writing
them from the draft a little. They are for
some exposed than they could be in the grand
and a good tent. I almost say your
lodges where so many of you can come together
and accomplish so much while my few letters
are so single handed. The future often looks
dark to one and it seems sometimes that the
smiles of heaven are almost withdrawn from
our poor rent distracted country and yet

there is something to be grateful for and
by one means the heart is thus strangely mild
mentioned.

But I must direct and crave pardon for my
(perhaps improperly) long letter, so if you have
followed one thus far, and especially at comparatively
so many notes I have written you must be
ready. I did not intend to say so much
but let my interest be my apology. Come with one
more point and in answer to your rational
question I have done, ladies remember that the
call for your organized efforts in behalf of our
army, no one from any Committee a Committee
but from Abraham Lincoln & Simon Cameron
and when they no longer need your labors they
will tell you.
