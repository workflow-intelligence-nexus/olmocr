on the whole it is certain of Christians are bound to keep a sabbath - it is in consequence of the fourth commandment. Yet the seventh day was the first Saturday, not Sunday - once have their setting apart the 1st instead of the 7th. The most added to the Christian law is imposed as a restraint upon Christian liberty.

The primitive Christians did not observe any sabbath - till the reign of Constantine. It was to meet together on the first day of the week for religious worship in the morning, in order to preserve their usual assembly during the rest of the week. The work of Justin Martyr, a very distinguished Christian, Adscendit who wrote about the year 150.

Various much light on this subject. It is a discussion between a learned and a Christian - the learned says the Christians because they set aside no sabbath that are in this respect like the Pagans. Justin makes the Christians admit that they observe the sabbath as a day of rest. He states that as "sabbath" is a sacrifice, so the sabbath began from money, so according to the council of your fathers. They were to end in Christ; again continuing his argument against the observance of the sabbath, he says: "Do you not see that the elements are never told not to keep a sabbath? Justin thus admits that the Christians did not keep a sabbath. He says that they were no more bound to the 7th than to the 1st. It then to conform to any other sabbath which had been abrogated by the Christian dispensation. The first day of the week was not observed as a sabbath until the 1st. 300 and a Constantine when Christianity had become the religion of the state. an edict then went forth commanding "all the Jews of Roman people of the occupation of all trades to rest on that respectable day of the week (the sabbath). But let those who are indebted in the country freely set full liberty subject to the business of agriculture because it often happens that no other day is fit for coming home and returning being we."

The sabbath did not seem to include the sabbath in his day. But it was not the long afterwards that the priesthood having gained great power in the state were enabled to enact the observance of agriculture - on the whole it is no part of the Christian duty to keep a sabbath. Any day is to be kept as long as it is the first day. It is an unwise usage - let those who make it continue to observe it, but do not compel others to do it. It has sprung from a false connection between church and state. It is the origin in the same sense with all the other papal authorities of Christianity which have overwhelmed the simplicity of our religion and in a flood of delusive ceremonies.
