Col. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay, N. Y.

My dear Col. Roosevelt:â€”

You have received a formal invitation from
Mount Pleasant Academy to attend its One Hundredth Anniversary.
I have been looking forward to this event hoping that you
could be present with us on that occasion.

You will remember, possibly, that in 1903 while
Governor, you reviewed our cadets and addressed them, together
with the townspeople, from old Junior Hall. All our patrons
and alumni have hoped that you might be here. Of course, I
understand that your engagement abroad must of necessity have
precedence over anything else. We should be glad, however, if
we could have an expression of good will from you for this
occasion.

Not many schools have reached the hundredth
year mark and we feel that Mount Pleasant Academy has earned
a right to honor and consideration.

We are all glad to welcome you back to this
country where your services and your personality are both
sincerely appreciated.

With best wishes for a pleasant and successful
voyage, I am

Yours very truly,

C. F. Bruce
