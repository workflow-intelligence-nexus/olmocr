209 East Capitol Street,
Washington, D. C. May 22, 1914.

Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay, New York.

Dear Sir:-

I am a Democrat, and have voted the straight Democratic ticket for more than 45 years, or from Greeley to Wilson, but it is my deliberate judgment that you will be the next man, if you keep your health, to be elected President of the United States. It is in the air, and he who runs can see, hear and feel it. I attended the meeting of Judge Lindsey and the Colorado women last night at the Armory on G street in this city. The meeting was an exceedingly large and enthusiastic one and ran from 8 P.M. until midnight. But one thing struck me particularly, and that was the way the mention of your name in connection with your settlement, and the way it was done of the Pennsylvania coal strike, was received. The speaker had referred in complimentary terms to President Wilson, but expressed a doubt as to whether or not he possessed the necessary amount of nerve and red blood to handle the Colorado strike situation, and then said that if you were President it would be settled and settled quickly and satisfactorily. At this point in his speech the crowd broke loose in the wildest cheers which lasted for fully a minute. It was not altogether a revelation to me, but it did show that your name was still the one great name to conjure with, and that the eyes of all the foes of Democracy were fixed upon you as the one man around which the opposition to the present administration of national affairs was rallying for the Presidential battle of 1916. I tell you this, for the reason that the papers of Washington do not mention it, but which was one of the most distinctive incidents of this really great meeting.

Very truly yours,
