was friends and the Capt. chide me for having left any thing behind at the depot as I told him I had done on reaching Falmouth. Nature we found another old friend Capt. Bailey in charge who instituted himself as watch over the goods until he sent them all up to Head Quarters.

My Ambulance came through that PM, but for fear it might not. Earl Sturgis had his taken down for me, and had supper arranged and a splendid serenade. I don't know how we could have had a warmer "welcome home" as the officers termed it.

Head Quarters are in the door yard of a farm house, one room of which is occupied by Miss S. and myself. My wagon is a little way from me out of sight and I am wishing for a tent and stove to pitch and live near them.

The weather is cold, and the ground covered with snow, but I could make me comfortable with a good tent, flour and stove, and should prefer it to a room in a rebel house one so generally occupied.

The 11th are a few rods from me, many of the officers call to see me every day. Col. Clark is very neighborly, he is looking finely now he was in this PM, and was going in search of Col.

I have received hand for them and shall get on track soon I trust.

Of Army movements nothing can be said with certainty, no two persons not even the Generals agree in reference to the future program. The snow appears to have deranged the plans very seriously, I have read calls from two Generals today and in the course of conversation I discovered that their views were entirely different. Genl. Bemiside stood a long time in front of my door today but to my astonishment, he did not express his opinion. Strange!

I have not suffered for want of the boots yet, but should find them convenient I presume, and shall be glad to see them.

The sore finger is much the same, not very troublesome, although somewhat
