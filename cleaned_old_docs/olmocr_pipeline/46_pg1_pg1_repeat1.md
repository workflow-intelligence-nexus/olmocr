St. Louis January 10, 63

Dear Sir,

My rent due 19 Dec. has not been paid and as the amount of $1500 is a matter of vital importance, I must request you, if not inconvenient, to inform me whether Palmer, Bean & Harkness have any claim against you. If so, when same may be paid. Mr. Palmer informs me that he would pay out of the money as soon as possible. After my return to St. Louis, I have a much smaller income for my family during winter, it will be exceedingly hard to lose this debt. My deep anxiety in regard to this, almost my last resource, will excuse this trouble.

I open my office as you were pleased to order.

Very truly yours,

A. B. Emerson
