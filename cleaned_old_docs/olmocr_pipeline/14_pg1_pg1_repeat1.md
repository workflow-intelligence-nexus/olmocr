My dear Col. Roosevelt,

It has added some year to my life to know that you have returned to God's land safe, sound and sound and hope you will regain your health and again come to and work out some truths for the people as this land of U.S. needs such minds to guide U.S. hoping for your good health.

I am yours,

Sincerely,

otherwise John A. Burnett.
