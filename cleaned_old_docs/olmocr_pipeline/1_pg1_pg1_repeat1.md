Bangor, Pa. May 22nd 1914

Col. Roosevelt I am one of D.E. Sickles old Regt & Brigade I served through all of the Civil War. During the 5 years was with Gen Sickles when he lost his leg. Then he left us. I regret your absence from this country during your trip to S.A. I saw Mr. Pinchot here & had a little talk with him about you & the political situation of the country. I am with you for the election of Gifford Pinchot as U.S. Senator. One law here must be repealed as we are deprived of voting for whoever we desire at the primaries. If you come to Easton or Bangor Pa I would like to see you. Address 25 Market St. Bangor.

Your very rest. Caleb Aker.
