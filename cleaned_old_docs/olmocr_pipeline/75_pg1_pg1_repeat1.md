Women's National War Relief Association.

The Mount Vernon branch of the Women's National War Relief Association held an executive meeting on Tuesday last.

Several new members were enrolled and gratifying reports were heard from all committees. It was decided to forward to the general society in New York the sums already raised by subscription, amounting to $55, which money is to be used in the furnishing of the hospital ship.

One hundred and six abdominal bandages have also been made by this society and have been approved and accepted.

It is not generally known that this Association is the only one working under Government direction. No salaries are paid and no expenses incurred. The society does the work, raises the money and the Government of the United States directs, controls and superintends in every way its outlay. The ship Relief has been fitted out as a floating hospital, complete in every detail, by the W. N. W. R., the awnings alone costing $1,500.

The Mount Vernon branch is working for this great object, and feels that if by their effort even one of the American soldiers or sailors, sick or wounded, can be spared the discomforts of the ordinary hospital transport, its work will be well done; and the public have the great satisfaction of knowing that every cent given to this Association is used for the comfort and benefit of our own brave men.

Prominent members of the society will from time to time, address the meetings, which will be held (by the kindness of the W. C. T. U.) in Willard Hall every Tuesday at 4 o'clock P. M.

All are most cordially invited to attend.
