Then how and embarrass!

This might have been a time when this terror has been

derived the but has not their

time past? Do not assume
to stir up any element that
may array thousands of misfit

and shoot against a scheme
they might under a sudden

I best right been defense to favor?

Come me. I have too long

intervals upon your time. If it

were known that I had written

this letter it would at once
be determined that it was

interference with military rule; and
I should have to suffer the

penalty. But duty is strange how

free and justice right our

humanity are stronger in their

claim than many human

considerations.

If my letter is not in place

protest me and let the wife

and young daughter of my

friend with almost broken hearts

plead for justice to a husband

a father, a guy shamed minister

of fear. I say "justice" for

it is justice to guard a man

from punishment he does deserve.

Do not if you can like

the wife involved in this matter

further than a wish that

that while he would desire
to be done to himself under

the rights of truth, justice and

humanity in the same existing

may be done to that friend,

for whom he feels.

Yours very truly,

W. T. G. Andrews
