May 22nd, 1914.

Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay, N.Y.

Dear Sir:

In Dec. 1903, I had passed through the Senate and House, at Salem, Oregon, a Resolution committing the Legislature of the State of Oregon, to your renomination at that time. I am still making another prediction, which you will observe from the inclosed interview. I am still with you, as I have always been, because I have felt that while you have seemed to think that I was guilty of criminal misconduct, someday I am going to convince you that you have been deceived, and I have never had any hard feeling towards you because I have felt that you had to believe what certain parties in Oregon felt in their duty, at all times to impress upon you.

I was a candidate for governor this year, and polled a splendid vote although there were eight other candidates in the field.

I am not writing this letter with any hopes of reward from you, or anything of that kind; I simply believe that you are the man to meet the demand of the country in the next Presidential contest, and I am for you. You will carry Oregon with a big majority. Everything indicates that the sentiment here now, is very strong for you.

Very sincerely yours,

Geo. C. Brownell
