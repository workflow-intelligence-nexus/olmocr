Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay, N. Y.

My dear Colonel Roosevelt:

Columbia University conferred upon you in 1899 the degree of LL. D.; therefore, being an honorary graduate of Columbia, you are cordially invited to attend the Alumni Luncheon as a guest of the Alumni Federation on June 3. The Luncheon will be held in the University Gymnasium where one of the Alumni tables will be specially reserved for the honorary graduates, of whom we hope there will be a large gathering.

We would appreciate your acceptance of this invitation and would ask that you send it at the earliest date, so that a guest ticket for admission to the luncheon may be mailed to you.

Appreciating your prompt response, I remain,

Very sincerely yours,

George Brokaw Compton
Executive Secretary
