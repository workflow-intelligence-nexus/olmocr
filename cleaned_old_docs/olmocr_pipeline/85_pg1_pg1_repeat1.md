before you again, only that I incidentally learned that our excellent Dr. Hitchcock has taken back from Roanoke other papers relating to the same subject, which will doubtless be land before you, and as I have an entirely different boon to crave, I find it necessary to speak.

I desire your Excellency's permission to go to Roanoke. I should have preferred my request weeks earlier, but I am called home to witness the last hours of my old Soldier father, who is wearing out the remnant of an oak and iron Constitution, scarred and tempered in the wild wars of "Mad Anthony." This last tale of the Redman's toil, a few more days, and the old Soldier's march is ended. Honorably discharged, his journeying home.

With this my highest duties clear, and I would fain be allowed to go and administer comfort to our brave men who paid life and limbs in defense of the freest born the fathers so dearly won.

If I knew my own heart, I have more but right wishes. I ask neither pay or praise, simply a soldier's fare and the sanction of your Excellency to go and do with my might, whatever my hands find to do.

In General Burnside's noble command are upwards of forty young men who on former days were my pupils.

I think I am safe in saying that I possess the entire confidence and respect of every one of them. For the Officers, their signatures are before you.

If my request appear unreasonable, and must be denied, I shall submit patiently, sorrowfully, but, trusting, hoping better things, I beg to subscribe myself

With the highest respect

[Signature]

Clara H. Barton
