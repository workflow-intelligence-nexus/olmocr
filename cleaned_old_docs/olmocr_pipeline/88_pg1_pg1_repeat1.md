Boston, March 24th, 1862.

Miss Clara H. Barton
North Oxford, Mass.

I beg to assure you, Miss Barton, of my cordial sympathy with your most worthy sentiments and wishes; and that if I have any power to promote your design in aid of our soldiers I will freely use it. Whenever you may be ready to visit Gen'l. Burnside's division I will cheerfully give you a letter of introduction, with my hearty approval of your visit and my testimony to the value of the service to our sick and wounded, it will be in your power to tender.

With high respect I am
Your ob. servant

John A. Andrews.
