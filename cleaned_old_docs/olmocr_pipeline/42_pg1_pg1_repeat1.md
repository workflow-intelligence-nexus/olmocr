Washington, D.C.

My dear Sir,

James B. Andrew, Lord of Savannah, N.C.

I am about to make an appointment at the State Department for his release. I shall to-day forward to Capt. Howard a copy of a letter which my friend has addressed to me as to a gentleman of high honor and integrity.

Yours truly,

[Signature]
