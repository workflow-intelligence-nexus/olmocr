Mr. Alfred T. Osmond,
Trenton, N.J.

Dear Mr. Osmond:

It would surely carry you back many years if I were to say "My dear pupil", still it would be true, and I want to return you my thanks at once for remembering that you were my pupil, and the dear old days of the school, that really meant so much, for they have lived until today, and never in any way has it passed out of the minds, I think, of any pupil I was permitted to have. Their life-long loyal allegiance to me is beyond my comprehension. Little, as many of them were, trifling as the days must have seemed, it is a most remarkable thing that all have remembered those few months and cherished them with a loyalty that the most ambitious teacher could but prize. scarcely a month passes that someone does not reveal him or herself to me, scattered over the whole country, until there are times when I feel that I should like to gather them all together once more and sit among them and the memory of the old child days.

I am glad that you told me of your home and surroundings, glad that they are so peaceful and that the sunset of life, coming to us all, brings as sorry lights as it does, and let us pray that, in its soft reflections, we may one day go out to that better land where the hues are always bright and, we trust, the paths easy.

I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Thanking you for your kind remembrance, I remain, dear Mr. Osmond,

Faithfully yours,

Clara Barton. "
