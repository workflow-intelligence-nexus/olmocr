Camp near Palermo, Va.
Head quarters Genl. Sturges (2nd) Division
Dec. 8th 1862.

Mr. Brown & Co.

Dear friends,

Mr. Wells returns tomorrow, and I improve the opportunity to send a line by him to you, not feeling quite certain if posted matter reaches directly when sent from the Army.

We reached Aquia Creek safely in the time anticipated, and to my great joy learned immediately that our old friend Capt. (Maj.) Head (of the 21st) was B. Master as soon as the boat was unloaded he came on board and spent the remainder of the evening with me. We had a home that I assure you remains till the next day, sent a lot of apples etc. up to the Capt's quarters, and proceeded with the remainder of our luggage in which it is needless to say ready transportable.
