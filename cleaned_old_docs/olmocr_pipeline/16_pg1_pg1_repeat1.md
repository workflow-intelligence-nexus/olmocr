Col. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay,
New York.

My dear Col. Roosevelt:

Regarding the three lion rugs which were returned to me for repairing:

I am enclosing you several photographs of lion head which I have mounted for the wall and with which I have been very successful; several men having sent me their lion rugs to put into this shape. I offer these as a suggestion for the rugs that you have returned, since, after two attempts, it seems impossible to find any way to keep your lion rugs from wrinkling; as I have said before, this is due to the original tanning.

In mounting these heads for the wall the body skin is not cut away, but tucked inside the head and shoulders. The mounts are much more satisfactory in appearance than the rugs inasmuch as they are more natural, and the main difference is that the skin gets now ware such as it is subject to on the floor.

I would strongly advise that your rugs be made into similar mounts, and would be very glad to hear from you regarding this.

I am under the impression that there is something to be fixed on the elephant tusk gong; if this is so, I would be glad to fix it whenever you so desire.

With congratulations for you recent successful trip and with kindest regards, I am

Very respectfully yours,
