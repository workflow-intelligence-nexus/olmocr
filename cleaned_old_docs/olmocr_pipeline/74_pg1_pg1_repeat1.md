The American Association of the Red Cross.

For the relief of suffering by war, pestilence, famine, flood, fire, and other calamities of sufficient magnitude to be deemed national in extent. The Association and its auxiliary societies operate under the provisions of the Geneva Treaty, promulgated at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1864, and signed since then by all the nations of the earth, including the United States, which gave its assent through President Arthur, in March, 1882.

The Woman's National Relief Association - President, Mrs. Chief Justice Waite, of Washington - is doing a work worthy the active interest of all women. Its annual report says: Eighteen months ago it undertook to supply government and in the field service by providing the stations with bedding, clothes, medicine and other articles for the injured and suffering crews and passengers rescued from death. Twenty stations have been so supplied. The Michigan sufferer next received prompt and efficient aid through the organization. Now it undertakes to furnish the marine hospitals with supplies not provided by Government, such as khaki clothing for invalid sailors. The association is now occupied with collecting and distributing relief for the sufferers by the Mississippi floods. The main object of the association is to organize the benevolent women of the nation into an intelligent, harmonious working body which, in the event of any great disaster from war, famine, flood, fire, pestilence, or any other cause, shall be ready to bring at once a vast, effective machinery of relief to those upon it. The association has its headquarters in Washington, D.C. It is proposed that there shall be auxiliary societies in every State of which agents are formed and in active operation. Any person can become a member by the annual payment of $1.00. Those who desire to form State auxiliary societies should apply for information to the General Headquarters, No. 616 Third Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
