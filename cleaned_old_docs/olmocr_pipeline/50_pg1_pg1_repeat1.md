Keeping Sabbath

A person means desires to comply with what he believes to be the will of God that concerning his own family, he
reasons from enforcing others to conform to his own
opinions. Such compulsion of others what people
may in the sense of persecution â€” God has given
more as authority to cause us to obedience to his
precepts.

Religion is a thing between a man and his maker
usually it be the voluntary offering of the heart it is
but a vain cold repetition of words which
cannot be acceptable to God. If a man does
not believe that religion exists it is his readiness
to abdicate from labor are the Sabbath be will submit
with reluctance. If this be real religion there will be
no justice on his part nor will it advance the party
of others.

There can be no more justice or submission in this
view than there would be in enforcing in favor
of God's policy upon the people, an abstinence from
what must declare but in enforcing the Mosaic
Christian to worship Mohamet.

1. There is no one precept in the New Testament
commanding us to keep a Sabbath. If we are
learned to keep one, it is an consequence of the
Mosaic law.

2. The language of the 14th commandment is, "The
Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord." But the
Christians keep the first day not the seventh.

3. There is not a single word within the Old or
New Testament nor even our allusions relating to the
substitution of the first day for the seventh. The
subject is not mentioned in any of the discoveries
of Christ nor in any of the epistles of his apostles.
