May 22, 1914.

The Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
287 Fourth Avenue,
New York City.

Dear Sir:â€”

Indiana County Progressives send you congratulations on your safe return from your epoch-making journey to South America.

Ours is the Pennsylvania County that gave you six hundred more votes than Taft and Wilson combined received. I hereby make a special plea that you honor us with a campaign speech when you tour Pennsylvania. Indiana, the county-seat, is situated at the center of the county and is entered by rail-roads and trolley-lines leading to different sections. When you come thousands will greet you, and in no uncertain tones.

Progressivism is a live issue here. We are in the fight to stay. We want no fusion or amalgamation with the Republican party, the party of Penrose and his ilk.

I am,

Sincerely,

J. Day Brownlee, Jr.
Chairman of Washington Party in Indiana County, Pa.
