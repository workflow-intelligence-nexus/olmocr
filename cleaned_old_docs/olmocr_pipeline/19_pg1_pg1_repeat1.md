Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
Oyster Bay, N.Y.

My Dear Honorable:

I am also enclosing a copy of a U.S. Letters Patent, that was issued to me Dec. 30th 1913, which is self-explanatory.

Now what I want to do is this: As I am a poor man, and am not able to finance this proposition, I would like to get an order from you for 10,000, or more, Badge Buttons, the more the better, and a large order such as you might want would enable me to get my proposition on the market. If I can get an order from you for 10,000, Buttons, or more, I will sign you a good Contract to the effect...
