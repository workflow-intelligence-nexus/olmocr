I am forewarned to a request which I deemed hardly at opportune, allow me without charge of objection to relate a few incidents of my service with the Army. I have just received a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, in which he says that the Army is in a state of great activity, and that I am to be placed in command of the troops. I have been ordered to take the field with the army, and believe I am the first officer of the Army to be placed in command of the Army.
