almost $200 more than the median wage of high school teachers throughout the country. From figures obtained from cities in the central section of the United States it was found that it was worth per year $394 more to carry bricks than to train children; $363 more to mould dough for bread than to mould boys and girls into citizens; $890 more to hammer hot iron than to hammer ideals, and $1024 more to build frameworks for buildings than frameworks for character.

There seems no solution of this problem save the intelligent study of the work done by teachers and the establishment of schedules of pay proportional to the preparation demanded and the necessary expenses incurred. When this is done and salary schedules put upon this basis no teacher in the country will be expected to start teaching at less than $1000, and the schedules will be so arranged that additional preparation, conscientious work and special ability will receive their reward in teaching in the same sense and as surely as these same elements would be rewarded in any other line of work.

The state of New Jersey ranks toward the top of the states in the matter of salaries paid to teachers. Because of this all branches of the educational system are greatly interested in an adequate adjustment of teachers' wages. With such an interest and a maximum of cooperation on the part of all groups involved there is no reason why New Jersey should not be the first state to put its teachers' salaries upon a satisfactory and scientific basis—that of paying all teachers a living and a saving wage in such a way that the maximum of service may be given to the schools.

A PROBLEM AT VENTNOR CITY

Ventnor City, Atlantic County, has one of the best school systems in the state. Its people are public spirited and are willing to spend money on their schools, and its superintendent, Mr. Halliday R. Jackson, is a leader of teachers. Mr. Jackson recently issued a statement entitled "Our School Problem," which is worthy of reproduction in the Bulletin.

What other town in the state has a broader or more comprehensive program than Ventnor City?

The statement follows.

There are cities where the classes average thirty-five pupils, but are they the places to which people move because of the schools? Is Ventnor City, which has built up a splendid reputation for its public schools because of its small classes and excellent teaching to drift into the conventional type of public school system?

Is it going to lead a humdrum conventional school life—quiet, unoffending and negatively happy—doing as many others do, doing it about as well as they do it and satisfied to do just that?

Or is Ventnor City going to keep the place it has won and still further extend its school facilities? Schools either move ahead or slide back. They cannot stand still and still hope to lead a moving procession.

To be an advertising feature the schools must be better than the average and so much better that the ordinary man can see it.
