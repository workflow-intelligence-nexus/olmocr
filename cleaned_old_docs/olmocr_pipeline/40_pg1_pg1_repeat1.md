Louisville Jan 7th 1862.

Hon. Joseph Holt.

My Dear Sir,

My much esteemed friend,

Mr. A. Y. Cleggitt, is desirous of obtaining an appointment as Pay Master or as Commissary of Subsistence in the U.S. Army.

Mr. Cleggitt has long been a resident of Louisville, and I know him to be a man of strict integrity, and is also possessed of fair business capacity and of industrious habits. In a word, he is altogether worthy of public and private confidence.

If you can be of any service to him in attaining his object you will much oblige.

Yours Truly,

W. H. Bullock
