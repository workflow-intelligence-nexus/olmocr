At six o'clock it commenced to thunder and lighten, and all at once the artillery began to play joined by the musketry, about two miles distant. We sat down in our tent and waited to see them break in upon us; but Reno's forces held them back. The old 1st Mass. lay between us and the enemy and they couldn't pass.

God only knows who is lost, I do not, for the next day all fell back. Poor Kearney, Stephens and Webster were brought in, and in the P. m. Kearney and Hantelson's division fell back through our camp on their way to Alexandria; we know this was the last. We put the thousand wounded we had them into the train. I took one car load of them, Mrs. Morell another, the men took to horses. We steamed off and two hours later there was no Fairfax Station. Reached Alexandria at ten o'clock at night, and oh, the report which met those poor men at the train. The people of the Island are the most noble band I ever saw or heard of. I stood in my car and fed the men 'til they could eat no more, then the people would take us home and feed us and after this we came home.

I had slept 1 1/4 hours since Saturday night; but I am well and strong and want to go again if I have need. Our forces are all back again in the old places around the city. McClellan's army here again and he in command of it all.

I am going to reach for my friends now. I have told you nothing of the old friends who met us among the wounded and dying on that bloody field. I have no heart to tell it today. Two huge boxes from Jersey have arrived. I don't know where we shall need them next.

To Archie and Missie Shaver, Yours,
Clara Barton.
