Washington, D.C., Aug. 30th, 1862

Judge I. Holt.

Sir,

You will accept my gratitude for kindness. While in the Capitol of our sorrowing bleeding country, I shall leave to-day for Louisville, Ky. to use (though feeble it may be) my influence to give a proper direction to the legislation of our native state.

I shall leave the consumption of the burnup on which I visited this city to yourself & the Hon. Samuel J. Casey.

Which hope you urge through as fast as practicable and direct to me to care of Capt. J. S. Bell Louisville, Ky.

I would be glad an order could be issued giving Mr. J. M. Shackleford a special command including that part of Ky. lying north of Cumberland River and south of Ohioâ€”west of line from Clarksville, Tenn. to Owensboro on Ohio River.

I am confident the Insurrections raids will be stopped.
