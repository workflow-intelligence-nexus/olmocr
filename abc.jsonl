Dear Sir: - I am a Democrat, and have voted the straight Democratic ticket for more than 45 years, or from Greeley to Wilson, but it is my deliberate judgment that you will be the next man, if you keep your health, to be elected President of the United States. It is in the air, and he who runs can see, hear and feel it. I attended the meeting of Judge Lindsey and the Colorado women last night at the Armory on G street in this city. The meeting was an exceedingly large and enthusiastic one and ran from 8 P.M. until midnight. But one thing struck me particularly, and that was the way the mention of your name in connection with your settlement, and the way it was done of the Pennsylvania coal strike, was received. The speaker had referred in complimentary terms to President Wilson, but expressed a doubt as to whether or not he possessed the necessary amount of nerve and red blood to handle the Colorado strike situation, and then said that if you were President it would be settled and settled quickly and satisfactorily. At this point in his speech the crowd broke loose in the wildest cheers which lasted for fully a minute. It was not altogether a revelation to me, but it did show that your name was still the one great name to conjure with, and that the eyes of all the foes of Democracy were fixed upon you as the one man around which the opposition to the present administration of national affairs was rallying for the Presidential battle of 1916. I tell you this, for the reason that the papers of Washington do not mention it, but which was one of the most distinctive incidents of this really great meeting. Very truly yours, Henry G. Bell."}

I offer these as a suggestion for the rugs that you have returned, since, after two attempts, it seems impossible to find any way to keep your lion rugs from wrinkling; as I have said before, this is due to the original tanning. In mounting these heads for the wall the body skin is not cut away, but tucked inside the head and shoulders. The mounts are much more satisfactory in appearance than the rugs inasmuch as they are more natural, and the main difference is that the skin gets now ware such as it is subject to on the floor. I would strongly advise that your rugs be made into similar mounts, and would be very glad to hear from you regarding this.

The work of Justin Martyr a very distinguished christian Advocate who wrote about the year 150 throws much light on this subject. It is a dialogue between a learned Jew & a christian. The Jew upbraids the christian because his sect observe no sabbath but are in this respect like the Pagans. Justin makes the christian admit & justify it & he sneers at the Jewish sabbath as a day of mere idleness - & states that as \\\"sabbath & sacrifice & oblation began from Moses, so according to the counsel of your fathers they were to end in Christ. Again continuing his argument against the observance of a Sabbath he says: \\\"Do you not see that the elements are never idle nor keep a Sabbath?\\\" Justin then admits that the christians did not keep a sabbath & insists that they were no more bound to do it than to conform to any other Jewish rite which had been abrogated by the christian dispensation. The first day of the week was not observed as a sabbath until AD 300 under Constantine when Christianity had become the religion of the State. An edict then went forth commanding \\\"all the judges & town people & the occupations of all trades to rest on that venerable day of the [week?] (die salis) But let those who are situated in the country freely & at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture because it often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn & planting vines &c.\\\" - The autocrat did not deemed it prudent to include the yeomanry in his despotic edict & it was not till long afterwards that the Priesthood having gained great power in the state were enabled to avert the business of agriculture - on the whole it is no part of the christian duty to keep a sabbath if any day is to be thus hallowed it is [?] not the 1st. It is an innocent usage - let those who wish it continued to observe it but do not compel others to do it - It has sprung from a foul unnatural union between church and state & has its origin in the same source with all the other papal corruptions of christianity which have overwhelmed and buried the simplicity of our religion under a flood of idolatory ceremonies.

Broad St., Trenton, N.J. Trenton, N.J., Jan. 17, 1902. Miss Clara Barton For years I have desired to write you and if possible receive a letter from you. Indeed I was about to do so at the breaking out of the Spanish War. I deferred, but now feel the desire pressing upon me. About the year 1854 I attended your school at the intersection of Crosswicks and Burlington Sts., Bordentown, and at the finishing of the larger school attended that, but not in your department, being placed under your direction in the principals room on the lower floor. Time has rolled rapidly away, almost half a century since then, still many of us are left, no doubt, but scattered, we know not where. I myself, ere the end of this month, the 30th, will be three score years of age. I am strong and well, always been very active, am a strong temperance advocate, a member of the Christian Church and living for the next life. I have had a dear little family, wife, son, daughter. Death claimed my wife in April 1886, my daughter in March 1901 leaving me a grandson, whom my son has taken. I have always tried to not lose sight of those past days, and have with pride pointed to the fact that I was one of your scholars. May God continue to protect and bless you. You have been a noble woman, how I would love to meet you and take your hand. Should you receive this please answer if with only a line. Respectfully yours, Alfred T. Osmond, Formerly of Bordentown, N.J. In reciting the story of how Clara Barton happened to be the founder of the first successful public school in New Jersey, at Bordentown, I have drawn from diaries, letters, and other memoranda, which I have found in my work of examining the vast accumulation of her literary relics, for the purpose of procuring material for the final biography of Clara Barton. I have so arranged the matter that it may appear largely as though written by herself, in fact, the most of my paper is in the form of quotations from her writings. While Miss Barton was a student at Clinton Institute, Oneida County, N.Y., she became acquainted with Miss Mary Norton. \\\"She had been much with me,\\\" Miss Barton writes, \\\"and almost unconsciously to myself, my teacher instincts had doubtless made her school life easy. Her letters home had called from the parents a most urgent request for me to promise them a visit in the future. This was of so genuine, hearty and at the same time delicate a nature that I could not find it in my heart to utterly decline. This was the home of Veteran Quaker, Richard Norton, of Hightstown, N.J. Early in the autumn of 1851 Miss Barton made the promised visit. \\\"As the October leaves commenced to fall, \\\" she continues, \\\"I ventured some remarks concerning home, but these were met by a protest so general and vigorous as to unbalance my decision and lead me to consider. \\\"My suggestion that I ought not pass so much time in mere idleness, and that there was nothing there to occupy me, drew from Uncle Richard the rejoinder, \\\"If thee could teach our winter school, Miss Clara, thee could find plenty to do. But thee could not keep a school could thee?\\\" I thought \\\"perhaps I might.\\\" \\\"I know thee could teach them Miss Clara, but these farmer boys that go to our school in the winter are men grown, and sometimes rough. Thee would not dare to undertake them?\" \"I thought I 'might be able to manage them', and it was decided that I attempt the winter school, consisting of about forty pupils, a venture never before essayed by a woman; \\\"Graded School?\\\" Ah no! not even a free school. Public schools were merely a"}

Thus, the public payment of a teacher for the children of a family placed them in the same category as having food or clothes provided at public expense. The people of no self-respecting cummunity would submit to that degradation. Public schools in that day ceased with the southern boundaries of New England and New York. Each scholar was assessed a certain amount, the aggregate of which formed the teacher's salary, something on the principle of select schools of today. This was a \"new thought\" to me, and fell with overwhelming force. I lived over again the days of little district schools in Massachusetts. Those, at the time, I had regarded as sorely lamentable; but this system for children of very poor, unfortunate, or unworthy parents seemed too unbearable. I think it was the first Monday in December 1851, when I classed my school and commenced teaching it. To me, there was a tender pathos in the faithful efforts of my bashful farmer boys and girls, and a mingled sympathy when the lengthened says of springtime called them to their accustomed duties. The winter's observation and thought had gone far towards maturing my plans. This individual system of schools seemed childish. I had playfully asserted from the first, that the financial method of their system was beyond my mathematics. I had, before now, kept time for working men, but never for children, and could not learn now. Trenton, Burlington and Newark, as cities, had made efforts at public schools, with more or less success; usually the latter, but all large towns or boroughs remained unchanged. ...... I talked matters over with \"Uncle Richard\" and it was arranged that I visit Bordentown. ... ... ... ... ... .... -3- Learning of a school committee, my first business was a personal call upon its chairman, Mr. Peter Suydam. From him I gained confirmation of the fact, that as a State, New Jersey had made legislative provision for the introduction of public schools, but that, owing to the strong opposition of public sentiment [it] had not proceeded to make the law obligatory. That the schools were generally, if not entirely, taught by ladies, more frequently in their own homes, as a means of eking out a slender living; widows and people who \"had seen better days\"; often elegant persons, but with no fitness for the position, and no ability for instruction beyond their own limited knowledge gained years before in some similar manner; when this limit was reached, and the pupil became aware of it, he became an \"undesirable citizen\" and was graduated into the street. The town was full of these children, and out of some seven hundred within the narrow limit of school age, only about three hundred and fifty were in school at all. The remaining hundreds bore all grades of reputation, from mere \"absentees\" to \"renegades.\" A year or two before, an effort had been made in the direction of a public school. A delapidated house, some little distance from the center of business had been fitted up, and a man engaged to teach a public school in it, but the effort failed, and the house was closed in disgrace and discouragement. All of this information left me in what might properly be termed \"a state of mind.\" Not that I was more discerning or more susceptible, or had any keener sense of justice or of humanity than those about me, but it was something so entirely new to me, and occurring rather in my own lines, that it made its impression. That was probably the only real difference between us. A case of environment. If I had been reared among them, I should have felt the same. \"There is nothing like getting used to a thing\" they tell us. One might add here, that nothing exceeds that,"}
{"image": "60", "text": "-6- sustain it. Mr. Suydam laid my proposition before the school board and the following afternoon, to my surprise, I was most courteously invited to sit with them in their deliberations. The subject was fairly discussed, but with great misgivings regarding the hazardous nature of the experiment and its probable result. However they came to the unanimous decision that the old school house be refitted, and a school commenced. The tardy preparations dragged into the second month, but finally about the fifth week, notice was given in the \"Bordentown Register\" and printed notices a foot square posted on all customary places, on spare boards, street corners, fences, market places, and tree trunks, that a public school, taught by Miss Clara Barton, in the brick house corner of Crosswick Street would commence on Monday next at 9 o'clock A.M., a good attendance was hoped for by the school committee. Signed,--etc. The early springtime waned in my waiting and it was nearing June when a prospective teacher with a decidedly New England aspect, a few books and desk outfit walked thoughtfully up the partially country street, turning abruptly to the right, as a solidly built brick house of small dimensions was reached, all firmly closed. A line of post and rail, \"Virginia fence\" commencing at the opposite corners of the house ran along, separating the yard from the opposite pasture land. On the top, or fifth rail of the fence were perched six boys ranging from ten to fourteen years, with the exception of one little brother of six; some shed, some barefoot, swinging their feet in concert. We sauntered about the yard, picked flowers, found a young four-leaf clover for good luck, discovered a tiny yellow bird's nest on a limb nearby, and decided to protect it faithfully, allowing no one to disturb it, and finally, as if just remembering that I had a key to the -7- house, unlocked the door, and went in. I recall at this day the combination of odors that greeted the old factories. The old musty smell of a long shut, untidy house, the pungent flavor of freshly cut southern pitch pine, and the bitter soot of the long iron stove pipe rusting for years. Altogether, it would have done credit to old, far-famed Cologne, said to be the worst smelling city in Europe. Save the half dozen little books I had, there was not a book in the house. They had brought none with them, from the doubtful impression at home, even if they would find any school, or stay if they did. But this was a matter of small importance, the lack of books being more than supplied by the two lusty black boards on opposite sides of the walls, and three school maps, of the world, the United States and Europe, which I had expressly named to the \"Committee\" as required among the furnishings. School was not thought of, but house keeping was the order of the day. by twelve o'clock we were spick and span, clean and all ready to go home for dinner. The stroke of one found us all at our posts. Almost imperceptibly we became very greatly interested in the maps, and little \"Alex\" was delighted with the \"big slates\", as the black boards were to him. They had never seen a blackboard in school. In that three hours until four o'clock we had travelled the world over, sailed with Columbus to discover America, grown indignant at his treatment. We had found how it came to be hot in some parts of the world and cold in others, and as we wiped our sweaty faces, \"wished it wasn't quite as hot her.\" We went to Africa for lions, leopards, elephants and great snakes; to Italy for oranges and grapes; to California for gold, and \"wished we had some of it here, we would have a better school house.\" We were travelers, and really knew more about the world and its way then we had ever know before in our lives."}

We had asked the appointment of one man among the many teachers, on to whose shoulders could be shifted the heaviest burdens, if desired. I commenced on Monday with a hoarse, tired voice, something I had never known. In spite of all palliatives, utterance grew weaker and more difficult, and finally ceased. The other teachers, and my own splendid pupils came tenderly to may aid relieving me of every duty possible to be done. To assure the proper arrangements and management of the school in its beginning, I hopefully ramained for some weeks at my voiceless post, but it was a vain effort. I began to realize that the weakening was not entirely confined to the voice. The labors of the past months had not been a pastime for either myself or my invaluable helpmeet, and in the midst of protests, loyal and loving, our resignations were given. We could scarcely say they were accepted. --------------------------- I have selected one letter from among my Grand Aunts papers to show with what affection and joy she looked back on the old school days in Bordentown. I have searched through the earliest diaries we have and find this little entry on the fly leaf;- Oct. 13/51 Left home for Htn. (Hightstown) Oct. 23 Thursday. Commenced school. Attended a weekly at Mrs. Tailors in the evening. And in the back of the same little diary I find May 27/ 52. Arrived in Bordentown. Immediately following this [little] entry is a list of \"Poets from Chaucer to the present day,\" which fill up some ten or twelve pages of the [little] tiny book."}

Dear Mr. Osmond;- It would surely carry you back many years if I were to say \"My dear pupil\", still it would be true, and I want to return you my thanks at once for remembering that you were my pupil, and the dear old days of the school, that really meant so much, for they have lived until today, and never in any way has it passed out of the minds, I think, of any pupil I was permitted to have. Their life-long allegiance to me is beyond my comprehension. Little, as many of them were, trifling as the days must have seemed, it is a most remarkable thing that all have remembered those few months and cherished them with a loyalty that the most ambitious teacher could but prize. Scarcely a month passes that someone does not reveal him or herself to me, scattered over the whole country, until there are times when I feel that I should like to gather them all together once more and sit among them and the memory of the old child days. I am glad that you told me of your home and surroundings, glad that they are so peaceful and that the sunset of life, coming to us all, brings as sory lights as it does, and let us pray that, in its soft reflections, we may one day go out to that better land where the hues are always bright and, we trust, the paths easy. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time. Thanking you for your kind remembrance, I remain, dear Mr. Osmond, Faithfully yours, Clara Barton. \\\" State of New Jersey Department of Public Instruction Trenton Calvin N.

{"image": "64", "text": "68 Education Bulletin It seems to the Commissioner that the school children and school teacher in New Jersey may wish to make a very small contribution- in the case of the children not to exceed a penny each, and in the case of the teachers not more than five cents each- to pay for the building, for its removal and the minor repairs that it needs, and possibly to establish a fun the interest of which could be used for its upkeep and to pay a small sum to a person to show the building to visitors. An amount not to exceed $1500 or $2000 would probably answer all purposes. It is the plan of the Commissioner a little later to ask for this donation from such schools as would like to take up the matter. If there should be an amount in excess of what is needed it could be turned over to the Red Cross. Of course this whole matter of purchasing the old Clara Barton school is a sentimental one, but the Commissioner could not bring himself to feel that it would be the wish of the school fraternity of New Jersey to see the building destroyed. It was necessary to move in the matter at once, and the Commissioner acting as he believed in the interests of and in accordance with the wishes of the teachers of the state, has taken this step. In a recently published biography of Clara Barton, by Percy H. Epler, occurs the following pertaining to her life as a teacher in the schools of New Jersey. Miss Norton recognized her friend's genius for teaching and in 1853 prevailed upon her to accept a post in the New Jersey village of Hightstown. Some ten miles or so away was Bordentown. Rumors of the extraordinary ability of the little woman to conquer schools where strong men had been driven out by unruly pupils radiated wherever Clara Barton went. From Highstown news of her power came to Bordentown. Prejudices existed there against public schools. Some were too denominational in religion to be bored enough to desire them; others too proud to send their children to the public school, which had often been styled \"free schools for paupers.\" Whenever the public school system had been tried among a people divided by sectarian quarrels, the citizens themselves split over the question, while the children, catching their lack of respect for a school system, broke up the sessions and ran wild on the streets. Miss Barton saw the need in Bordentown and she went to meet it. \\\"A public school is impossible,\" she was told. \"It has failed every time.\" \"Give me three months and I will teach free,\\\" was her challenge. Never was there a campaign against odds but Clara Barton answered it with this argument of action. She did not demand that something should be done' she demonstrated that it could be. January 1920 69 She took a tumble-down unoccupied building with six pupils. In five weeks the building was too small. Each of the six pupils had become a living advertisement. Emerson has said that it is not the school that educates-it is the schoolmate. Clara Barton recognizing this truth and sought to reach out through these first pupils. She studied each child individually.... In this was the magic of her success. Something of the way in which she was regarded is shown by the following letter from a member of this first class-George Ferguson, now of Brazil, Indiana. \\\"My memories of Miss Barton are certainly the most pleasant. She was kind to her students, pleasant in her work, gentle in disposition and took an interest in us all. We loved her almost as much as we loved our mothers, and it was not without pangs of regret that we saw her give up her pupils and school work on account of failing health. ...I don't think she ever had a pupil but that loved her. Bad boys interested her as much as the good ones. The first letter I ever wrote in my life I wrote to Miss Barton. When she went away on her vacation she asked her students to write to her. We all did, and she answered all with personal letters. I can remember myself writing that letter as if it were only yesterday, and I was mighty proud of the answer I received. Since then I have been corresponding with her and have letters from her which I prize highly.\" ... \"Remembering that fully one-fifth of my life has been passed as a teacher of schools,\\\" she remarked twenty years after, \\\"it is not strange that I should feel some interest in the cause of education, some sympathy with those who labor in it as its teachers, some affiliation with the parents and people who bear its expenses, and secure its benefit, and some interest in the children and youth who receive them.\\\" What community in New Jersey will be the first to honor itself and to honor Miss Barton by attaching her name to a public school building? VISIT-THE-SCHOOLS WEEK To Local Boards of Education, Superintendents of Schools, Principals and Teachers: During each of the past three years a week has been designated as Visit-the-Schools Week. Last year more than thirty thousand persons visited the schools during the week set apart for this purpose. The week which is designated as Visit-the-Schools Week this year is the one beginning Monday, February 16. It is hoped that a larger number of persons will visit the schools this year than visited them last year. This week comes at a time of the year when fathers are not so busy as they are at some other seasons, and they, as well as the mothers, can visit the schools."}
{"image": "65", "text": "74 Education Bulletin almost $200 more than the median wage of high school teachers throughout the country. From figures obtained from cities in the central section of the United States it was found that it was worth per year $394 more to carry bricks than to train children; $363 more to mould dough for bread than to mould boys and girls into citizens; $890 more to hammer hot iron than to hammer ideals, and $1024 more to build frameworks for buildings than frameworks for character. There seems no solution of this problem save the intelligent study of the work done my teachers and the establishment of schedules of pay proportional to the preparation demanded and the necessary expenses incurred. When this is done and salary schedules put upon this basis no teacher in the country will be expected to start teaching at less than $1000, and the schedules will be so arranged that additional preparation, conscientious work and special ability will receive their reward in teaching in the same sense and as surely as these same elements would be rewarded in any other line of work. The state of New Jersey ranks toward the top of the states in the matter of salaries paid to teachers. Because of this all branches of the educational system are greatly interested in an adequate adjustment of teachers' wages. With such an interest and a maximum of cooperation on the part of all groups involved there is no reason why New Jersey should not be the first state to put its teachers' salaries upon a satisfactory and scientific basis-that of paying all teachers a living and a saving wage in such a way that the maximum of service may be given to the schools.

Its people are public spirited and are willing to spend money on their schools, and its superintendent, Mr. Halliday R. Jackson, is a leader of teachers. Mr. Jackson recently issued a statement entitled \"Our School Problem,\" which is worth of reproduction in the Bulletin. What other town in the state has a broader or more comprehensive program than Ventnor City? The statement follows. There are cities where the classes average thirty-five pupils, but are they the places to which people move because of the schools? Is Ventnor City, which has built up a splendid reputation for its public schools because of its small classes and excellent teaching to drift into the conventional type of public school system? Is it going to lead a humdrum conventional school life-quiet, unoffending and negatively happy-doing as many others do, doing it about as well as they do it and satisfied to do just that? Or is Ventnor City going to keep the place it has won and still further extend its school facilities? Schools either move ahead or slide back. They cannot stand still and still hope to lead a moving procession. To be an advertising feature the schools must be better than the average and so much better that the ordinary man can see it."}

J. J. DANA, Colonel, Q. M. D. No. 48 \u2013 Extract from annual report of Captain J. M. Moore, assistant quartermaster United States army, for the year ending June 30, 1865. WASHINGTON, D. C. The charge of the national cemeteries and burial of deceased soldiers and others dying in the service of the United States in hospitals in and about Washington is under the jurisdiction of this office, and is probably the most important of my specialties. It was deemed advisable, at the expiration of the burial contract, December 31, 1863, for the government to manufacture all the coffins required for interments in the national cemeteries, as well as those needed for shipment to distant points. The coffins now issued cost less than one-half the price paid by contract, and are far superior. The hearses used for transportation to the graves are covered ambulances, painted black, and are well suited for the purpose. The tablets or headboards are principally of white pine, with the exception of some four thousand of black walnut, purchased more than two years ago. They are painted in white and lettered in black, with the name, company, regiment, and date of death. I would here remark that unless tablets are painted before lettering, the wood will absorb the oil in the paint and the rain soon wash off the lead in the lettering. By much pains and labor I have succeeded in preparing a mortuary record for future reference, giving a succinct history of the deceased, every page of which has been compared with the records of hospitals, and up to the present date believed to be the most reliable register of the dead extant. Information is daily furnished to numerous friends respecting deceased soldiers, and frequently before it can be obtained elsewhere, as the record is always kept up to date, no matter how great may be the mortality.

JOHN V. FUREY. Captain and Assistant Quartermaster. ASISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE. Depot of Washington, Washington, D. C., July 1, 1865. GENERAL: In accordance with Special Orders No. 132, Headquarters Middle Military Division, Washington, D.C., June 7, 1865, I have the honor to report as follows: On the evening of June 8 I left Washington, D. C., for Belle Plain, where I joined Colonel Bird, of the 1st regiment 1st army corps, and proceeded to the battle-fields of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania Court House for the purpose REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR. 263 of superintending the interments of the remains of Union soldiers yet unburied, and marking their burial-places for future identification. This work was commenced on the 12th, and completed on the 24th of that month. Careful search was made over the above-mentioned battle-fields, and the remains of all soldiers, both Union and rebel, interred, and headboards, with name, rank, and regiment, placed at each grave (with some exceptions in cases of rebels) when it was possible to identify the deceased. The words \\\"Unknown United States soldiers, killed May 10, 1864,\\\" on a neat tablet, mark the remains of our own soldiers that could not be identified. On the battle-ground of the Wilderness two cemeteries were laid out, enclosed by a paling fence. Cemetery No. 1 is on the Orange Court House turnpike, about two miles from the Wilderness tavern, and contains the remains of one hundred and eight men. Cemetery No. 2 is on the Orange Court House plank road, about two and a half miles from the junction of the Orange Court House turnpike, and contains the remains of five hundred and thirty-four men. The sites are well adapted for the resting-place of those who fell in the vicinity, having been selected where the scenes of carnage appeared to be the greatest. It was no unusual occurrence to observe the bones of our men close to the abatis of the enemy; and in one case several skeletons of our soldiers were found in their trenches. The bones of these men were gathered from the ground where they fell, having never been interred, and by exposure to the weather for more than a year all traces of their identity were entirely obliterated. On the battle-field of Spottsylvania but few men were found unburied, many of them having been interred by a Mr. Sandford, who resides at Spottsylvania Court House, in compliance with an agreement to that effect with General Sherman while on his march to Washington city. Over seven hundred names were found on this battle-field, and tablets erected in memory of the deceased. It was my intention to remove those partly buried to a suitable site for a cemetery; but the weather being exceedingly warm, and the unpleasant odor from decayed animal matter so great as to make the removal impracticable. They were, however, carefully re-covered with earth and entirely hidden from view. Hundreds of graves on these battle-fields are without any marks whatever to distinguish them, and so covered with foliage that the visitor will be unable to find the last resting-places of those who have fallen until the rains and snows of winter wash from the surface the light covering of earth and expose their remains.

The Divine Right of Every Child to be Well Born. VOL. VI. WASHINGTON, D. C , JUNE 1, 1881. NO. 10. PARENTAL LEGACIES. A PAPER READ BEFORE THE INSTITUTE OF HEREDITY, CONVENED IN BOSTON, MAY 25, 1881. CAROLINE B. WINSLOW, M. D. To a toil-worn reformer this goodly meeting is truly a most cheering event-a green oasis in a vast desert of perversion, ignorance and hap-hazard discord. That ere the close of the nineteenth century, this congregation of philanthropists and reformers, men and women have met, to take counsel one of another and solemnly consider the most wise and legitimate methods of improving our common humanity, the most reasonable means whereby the world may become healthier, happier, purer, truer, through a knowledge of the laws of hereditary transmission. Heredity means (according to Webster) descended by inheritance, ancestral, patrimonial, inheritable. But to use a more familiar definition, \\\"The science that treats of the transmission of physical, mental and moral traits to descendants.\\\" Many sided and perplexing as is a successful study of our subject, with its centuries of accumulated crookedness and mystery, we believe, with the aid of inspiration and the light of science, human intelligence and beneficence will be found competent to unravel this tangled mass of evidence and patiently arrange into order, testimony of the most valuable character, and evolve lessons of wisdom that will essentially advance the interests of the human race. Of course we are only seed sowers, and can only work with the implements and materials produced by our generation. We must begin with those already born and those that will be born in our day. It will be a vast benefit to posterity if we can so enlighten the rising generation that they will realize the necessity of studying their own patrimony, and that of the one they propose selecting for life companionship. If only this is accomplished the tide of human wisdom will have turned its efforts in the right direction and the opportunity for developing the most sublime traits of human characters will be afforded. For I predict our coming heroes will not be battle-stained and blood-stained men with maimed and crippled bodies, but men and women who will be canonized for their self-renunciation and the wise ordering of their lives for the good of others, for good works, diligence and skill. Self-conquest will be an achievement recognized and honored by all men, and will become the power which shall marshal their hosts against such spiritual enemies as tyranny, selfishness, ignorance and lust. With such noble ends to be accomplished we look with great interest and solicitude to this new departure, this Institute of Heredity, and inquire what are the methods and plans by which such desirable results will be brought about ? If, by familiarity with our inherited traits and an inventory of possibilities, aught is discovered that cannot be satisfactorily transmitted to prove a joy and blessing to progeny, individual responsibility will be so patent that an irremediable defeat will settle the question of parentage at once, and an heroic resolution taken that their plague-spot shall die off from the face of the earth and be known no more forever. But if by knowledge of the laws governing development and a wise application of the law of selection, whereby the virtues and defects of contemplated partners may complement each other, with the sustaining praise and stimulating joy of establishing a new grade that shall lead to a desirable pedigree, and doing one's best toward redeeming the mistakes and blunders of the past, the results cannot fail of being most happy. When fathers and mothers become as solicitous for the mental and moral qualities they leave behind them as they do of houses and lands, government bonds, promissory notes, articles of virtu, and other worldly and perishable possessions ; when they strive to bequeath such priceless treasures as a healthy physique and well developed brain to their heirs, \\\"the last will and testament\\\" of progenitors will be less liable to litigation, legacies will be of more permanent value, and become objects of profound veneration. The spendthrift will not forget the sacredness of his inheritance ; the man or woman, tempted by appetite will possess a double incentive to resistance. That rich, pure blood, may be transmitted untainted by any voluntary self-indulgence, and what of taint or discord we detect in ourselves will become a life-work to eradicate and conquer by the persevering observance of physical and moral hygiene ; that only grace, health, and beauty be handed down to crown with joy the lives of coming ages of men. Then the unfortunate victim of malformation, of feeble intellectual and moral sense, with scrofula, syphilis, or insanity poisoning his blood, will be looked after and cared for by legal but humane authority, and will not be permitted to transmit his curse to posterity. The restraint imposed by legal enactment, reason and conscience, will be the tender but effectual means used to check this class [*1881-2 Blue Anchor*]"}
{"image": "70", "text": "2 THE ALPHA, JUNE. of population. For it will be considered \\\"a sin to entail crime upon society, and equally a sin to make one's house a sepulcher, full of death and blight.\\\" There has recently come to our knowledge a family of eight idiots, all grown to men's estate, with stalwart bodies, but not sufficient mental calibre to care for their personal wants any better than in early childhood. Their father and mother are cousins. With the habits common to ignorant people, blood poisoned with whisky and tobacco, the tissues of the body built up on pork and corn ; is it surprising that these old people are utterly discouraged in their poverty and the failure of all the objects of life ? Would not legislation that would have interfered in preventing the marriage of such persons, or after their marriage, have interposed its beneficent restraints to have prevented these eight crimes from burdening the world have been wise and timely ? \\\"This is the class that are damned into the world, not born.\\\" \\\"It becomes the duty of scientists and reformers to see to it that this class of parasites do not drain the life of the parent tree.\\\" Such are the penalties and disappointments that result from a life of ignorant sensuality and irresponsibility in many families. This may be considered an extreme case. But do we not see such results in a degree all around us ? How often do we hear of good men, ministers of the Gospel and devout Christians, having wild, vicious sons and unreliable daughters, and how often is the question asked, \\\"Why should such God-fearing families be so afflicted ?' A great stride forward will have been taken when the religious and secular mind shall have been disabused of the popular error that God creates every child that is born, calls him forth into life by the fiat of His will. Here human responsibility is ignored by the masses and Divine Providence becomes the scape-goat for our sins and shortcomings. But this immunity does not extend to the breeding and improving of domestic animals. The farmer and stock raiser knows to a certainty that if he wishes fine cattle and spirited horses he must be wise in selection, careful to supply nutritous and abundant food and provide just enough exercise to insure the health and vigor of the female. This point is aptly illustrated by a correspondent in a recent number of the Woman's Journal. The writer, a wife and mother, is over-burdened by housekeeping and the care of her little children; her husband stupidly oblivious of the fact. She says: \\\"Once we were riding; at the foot of a hill he told me to get out and walk up as his mare would foal in July. My baby would be born in August.\\\" He remembered to be kind to his horse and care for his colt in embryo. He knew his responsibility there, but he had no thought for his own child. I fear this is not an unusual case, for, alas, it is the experience of many wives. Another one writes: \\\"I have no money only what I can get on the sly.\\\" Meaning if she could find small coin in her husband's pocket she would take it, if she thought he would not miss it. His children will inevitably be sly and thievish. But he feels no responsibility in the matter. They are gods children not his. It would make a vast difference in that man's conduct, and still more in the character of his children, if he believed himself to be a free moral agent in this matter of generation, and while holding the balance of power is largely responsible for the endowment of his children. \\\"As he sows so shall he reap.\\\" We are told that God wills the salvation of all souls, but he cannot and will not save souls without human help. This knowledge will mark a new era in the history of human progress and reform. Men will select their wives for their vigorous health, their moral and spiritual tendencies by inheritance and the effect of personal habits of life, and the probable result to their children from combination with [t]heir own peculiarities; before they dare jeopardize the welfare of offspring, who are so helplessly dependent upon their ancestors not only for the breath of life, but for qualities that will make their lives desirable, not an intolerable burden to themselves and society; that will endow them regally , not impoverish them with discord and disease; crown them with transcendent talent, not blast them with idiocy. When this great day shall have dawned upon the children of men, the work of the church-Christ's church on earth-will not be the expounding of doctrine, calling upon men to save their souls by sprinkling or emersion, while they despise and neglect their bodies, but shall be the healing of the great leprosies of society, the cleansing of sensuous lives, the diminution of criminal classes, the care and education of youth by every elevating and salutary influence. Teachers and preachers must begin by casting out their own selfishness and cultivating virtue and purity in their souls, and so manifest it in their lives that from them will emanate an attractive radiance that will draw the sin-sick and heart weary unto them, to heal and bless. They must recognize physical law to be as divine and immutable as spiritual law, and impress up the minds they would direct that there can be no real virtue except when manifested through a healthy body. Therefore the attainment and preservation of physical health becomes a cardinal virtue. And above all must we steadfastly live our principles of beneficence and purity if we expect to do good to others. Especially must we live lives of sexual holiness and pure continence except for procreation, whether married or single. Sexual abuses are the great sins of our day. The social ulcer, the cancer at the heart that is draining our strength, consuming our life and vital force, defrauding little children and the cause of the increase of crime, disease, premature death and all the sorrows that blast our lives and go to make up its wastes and burdens. False teachers have proclaimed the doctrine of physical necessity,\\\" have wailed about \\\"sexual starvation\\\" and \\\"over-population.\\\" Medical teachers and physicians have recommended marriage or concubinage as a specific for sexual diseases. All manner of protections and prevention to conceptions, with f\u0153ticide, (which often means suicide,) have been devised. Some have even professed consecration of sexuality, which proves to be another name for sensual indulgence without procreation, but to me they are all false teachers, false prophets, that cry \\\"peace, peace, when there is no peace.\\\" THE ALPHA, JUNE. 3 They all lead to the same results-disgust, loathing, disease. The desecration of the God-like creative power and sacred sexual function creates a perfect pandemonium in the soul. Of it are born satiety, disgust, jealousies, contentions, nervousness, disease, and death of all that makes life sweet and desirable. Thus is Milton's allegory of the fallen angel re-enacted in our hearts and by nearly every family in the land. In this condition children are too often conceived, added to the rebellion of the wife against the injustice of enforced maternity, and the plotting against, or at least the desire to destroy the embryo. What wonder that we are overrun with criminals of every shade and degree, God's likeness transformed into demonical distortions, and the world burdened with the support of jails, penitentiaries, reformatories, insane, deaf, mute, blind and idiot asylums, with a gibbet in every township. All these disasters follow the desecration and profanation of the most sacred function with which we are crowned. The creative power, in combination with reason, allies us more closely to an Infinite Creator thank any other gift. Every infringement of the law of continence for sensual purposes to an enlightened conscience brings its own shame, debasement, and contrition. Let no one say :this standard is too high;\\\" that \\\"it is not possible of attainment.\\\" I assure you it is. Many families are this day trying this method of living. And they report themselves as being happier and healthier, more loving and cheerful and before. We cannot recognize the necessity of physical expression of the sexual nature same for its legitimate and creative function. Unlike the natural physical instincts which demand food, shelter, warmth and clothing, which are necessary for the renovation of the blood and building up the waste tissues, and the growth and health of our bodies, this is under the control of out emotional nature, and should be dominated by our reason and will power, as every expression of it reduces vitality and wastes life force. No man or woman in health and symmetrically developed has any desires, but through the imagination or sympathy. Like the shedding of tears, health or happiness would not be impaired by years of abstinence, but like weeping, indulgence always depresses nervous energy. This doctrine of continence is the stone which all social reformers have rejected or neglected. I now present it as the chief corner-stone of the institute of Heredity. If accepted, it will set the institute on a firm, enduring base. Storms or floods, winds or flame, nor the power of hell can never prevail against it, for it will stand upon a rock. Security and peace will dwell with wisdom within its borders, and none shall make afraid or soil its pure escutcheon with slander or evil passions. This is really the whole of salvation each soul must work out for himself. Brothers and sisters, I exhort you to present your bodies holy, acceptable to the Lord, which is your reasonable service. We should teach to others the truths we ourselves have learned. In the autumn of 1880, plans, long considered by a few benevolently -minded women, culminated in the formation of the Women's National Relief Association, having its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the object of which is so to organize benevolent effort that the women of the nation, by concert of action, may have in readiness for any sudden or imperative necessity arising from conflagration or other disaster, epidemics, famine or war, such sanitary aid and material as the occasion calls for, and to insure their economical and equitable administration. It has also the present specific object of supplying without delay the United States Life-Saving Stations with beds, blankets, warm clothing, and other necessaries for the preservation and comfort of persons rescued from shipwreck. It is desired that auxiliary societies shall be formed in every state as soon as possible, in order that much needed supplementary aid may be rendered to the life-saving service during the ensuing year, and that as speedily as possible the organization may be in a condition for efficient work in the other direction alluded to. One hundred and ninety-six life-saving stations are established and sustained by Government. Though enough has been written of late to familiarize the public with the details of the service, probably few realize how arduous are its duties. The force employed does not admit of relief relays. The same men who patrol the beach must drag the life-saving apparatus for miles on the sandy beach, man the life-boat, carry on for hours the perilous work of rescue, and then, spent and exhausted themselves, work perhaps hours longer in preserving the lives they had saved. A crew frequently returns to the station, after the racking labors of a whole day or night, faint with hunger, cold, drenched through and through, cut or bruised, and spent with fatigue. They bear with them a wretched group of reduced, sometimes with women and children in the number, livid, ragged, half-naked, hurt, famished, wet, and frozen. The station fire is out, or low; no food prepared; nothing ready; everything to be begun. The crews are so short handed that no one can be left to make ready for the home comers and their precious freight. The fire must be renewed, and the reduced made comfortable, with but little means to that end. There is a cot and blankets at each station for each man employed, and, as far as these will suffice, they are used for wave-sent guests. The government supplies no clothing, but the surfmen gladly give their own only changes of dry appeal to replace the wet clothing of the rescued, themselves going wet for hours, and taking such rest as can be found on the hard boards around the station fire. Occasionally circumstances require that shipwrecked persons should be out-fitted with clothing. A man came ashore from the wreck of the A.S. Davis with only the band of his shirt left on him by the raging buffeting sea. Another was cast ashore without vestige of a garment. One of the surfmen, from his own scanty store, supplied his wants. The Government makes no provision by which that surfman can be repaid. It is enough that these poor"}

But raptures exert no healthful influence, unless the process which evolves them is strictly scientific in its bearings, and the true uses of life always include this characteristic. The riches of the universe are borne home triumphantly to the heart of the philanthropist without the wish to revel in the delight which is the consequence. The happy miner of investigation who finds jewels of inestimable value upon the point of his spade, hugs not himself with swinish delight, it is to be hoped, because the avails will enable him to gorge his senses with intoxicating pleasure, of no exalted nature, but he feels that such gems contain the fairy mystery which under his auspices will beautify his own neighborhood, give employment and relief to the poor, and the thrill of holy delight which permeates his whole frame arises from the fact that his own nature contains a happy mingling of love and wisdom in such divine proportions that the whole world can reap some benefit from his manly and benevolent exertions. I humble think that the highest raptures will come to us in moments when least expected, and devotion to the loved one is best shown by contributing to his highest good. Raptures of all descriptions are only attendants of surpassing loveliness, who wait upon duty as the dew of labor pours from her noble brow. The best happiness of the heart is like the music of the well-tuned lyre, the perfume of the rose, the purple light of the evening cloud. But when emotional cravings break up or become the whole business of existence, the harmony of our being loses its best significance, and, as a great writer remarks, life ceases to retain its noblest energies, and \"passes languidly into destructive and unmeaning dreams of rapture and anguish.\" ALHAZA CROFT. HEREDITY, HOW OPPOSED. The doctrine of heredity, so ably argued in late numbers of THE ALPHA, deserves further notice of the hindrances of its acceptance. I essay to discharge the office. The hindrances might be compressed in one - the ready acceptance of the cheap, the superficial, the pretentious; or we may specify two principal forms of the same tendency. One identifies baptism with regeneration, the sign is exalted into the thing signified, the sacramental water removes the stain and disabilities of inherited depravity. Consistently saints must be celibates. Children are forbidden to them who might most boldly claim the promise to them and to their children. Not more preposterous if a ranchman should restrain the choice of his flock and breed only from meaner cattle. Another portion of the Christian community ignores the law that the spiritual nurture of the child begins before its birth, or admits it only in its evil applications, as in case of the expectant mother indulging in irregular appetites or viler passions and transmitting to her offspring unwonted depravity in the same direction. The law should be recognized as equally available for good, as was found in case of Jeremiah, Isaiah and the Baptist, (Jer. i, 5; Is. xliv, 15; Luke i, 15.) Nothing exceptional here, all normal and to be expected, when ever it may be said of parents, \"They were both rightous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.\" O. vi, 7. Despite the principles running through the Holy Writ, despite the teachings of science, philanthropy and common observation with a large portion of the Christian community, the beau ideal Christian begins life a heathen, goes astray as soon as he is born, speaking lies, though born of Christian parents, and perhaps dedicated to God in baptism, he is still accounted an alien till the revival comes along to effect his conversion. The utmost that parents are encouraged to hope is the early conversion of their children. Sanctification from or before birth is at most admitted a bare possibility, may be in rare cases; is not accepted as the normal and expected thing, and not expected is not realized. Under a ripened Christianity we shall not hear of the conversion, early or late, of children of Christian families. Children will be born with the germs of divine life implanted in them, to be quickened into activity. Indeed I believe that, to a hopeful extent, such is already the case, that of many Christians the practice is better than the theory, proving that a sanctified parentage assures a sanctified progeny, and that the reported conversion of children is rather the revivification of a principle afore imparted. W. W. \"PUISSANCE OBLIGE.\" Under the above title, the Cambridge Review of the 2d ult., in an article which well deserves attention, upon the duties of the strong towards the weak, says: \"There exists in our community a class of persons to whom its teachings have as yet been very imperfectly applied - why, it would be hard to say, for whatever claims weakness has upon strength, they possess in a superlative degree. Mr. Lecky, in a flourish of sublime nonsense, has dubbed them 'the priestesses of humanity,' bearing, since some must bear it, the sin of the world. And who are these majestic priestesses? They are not women. They are children, women-children, at least when they first assume their sacred functions. Their are young girls in their teens, that is, of the age when our daughters and sisters have hardly got into 'long dresses,' when they are still at school, or in the school-room, when they prefer a circus or a pantomime - the babies! - to a party 'where you have to be so proper, you know.' Of such are the 'priestesses of humanity.' \"With this difference. That they have never had a father to romp with them, or a brother to protect them from a whisper of insult. That from the first, life has meant to them hard work, privation, severity, servitude. That for many of them - 'not so much born as damned into the world' - it has meant education in evil and encouragement, nay, compulsion to vice. That the happiest of them have not been sheltered from temptation; THE ALPHA, JUNE 7 that the wisest of them are very ignorant and childish; that the richest of them are very poor. \"And what have we done for our women-children? * * * \"This is what we have done for the women-children, who might have been our own. \"We have taught them that a first downward step is irretrievable, and stamps upon them a brand which nothing can efface. We have goaded them on to fresh evil with all the force of cruel contempt or frigid indifference. We have herded them together in one outcast class, without distinction of character or experience in sin. We have hardened them, often in periods incredibly short, unsexed them, made of them drunkards, blasphemers, tempters, fiends in human form. We have done this. \"Even when we have had too much respect for womanhood and for ourselves, to heap fresh ignominy upon them, we have been responsible for their blood, inasmuch as we have stood aloof, and have deemed with a cynical apathy, or with the fastidious shrinking of a mistaken refinement, that their fate did not concern us. \"'Upon the soul of every individual amongst us did a portion of guilt rest, as long as the slave trade remained legal,' said Coleridge, and as long as society's laws, whether sanctioned by act of Parliament or no, ordain a yearly holocaust of thousands of its weakest members, so long will their blood be upon the head of every responsible member of society. \"Yet there is a change coming. There is on the horizon a cloud scarcely bigger than a man's hand which is destined to grow and grow till it overspreads the sky. It is the awakening of women to their responsibilities toward their young sisters. The truths that are dawning with irresistible but gradual force upon the reasoning minds of men have laid hold with a sudden fiery grip of the impassioned spirits of women, and caused the scales of age-long custom, the 'stiffening crust' of tradition to fall from their eyes. They are going forth to raise the newly-fallen, to melt the hardened with love, to wipe out a past of sickening horror in a future of hope and calm; they are moreover working socially for justice, for honesty, for a loftier purity, for the practical extension of the kingdom of Christ.\" \"Faust says: 'The Woman-Soul leadeth us Upward and on.' \"Not that we are to get a woman to smuggle us into heaven when we are sick of our follies and sins; not that we are to do our religion and morality by deputy, admiring women's purity and goodness with sentimental wistfulness, and contenting ourselves, for our own part, with 'half the virtues;' but that we are to defer to the weaker, to surrender to the needy and the oppressed, to do battle for the poor, to aspire with the pure in heart, to remember: \"Puissance oblige.'\" --The Shield. \"SEXUAL ORGANISM AND ITS HEALTHFUL MANAGEMENT.\" James C. Jackson, M. D., in his 'Sexual Organism and its Healthful Management,\" in a chapter all ought to read, page 258, says: \"I am satisfied, from a thorough study of the organic relation of the sexes, that the faculty of amativeness has a two-fold purpose, and should be always gratified by either sex from this point.\" But I am not \"satisfied\" that this is so, nor has the world ever had a fair chance to test the other side of theory. Men and women, like plants and animals, have gone on for millions, and perhaps billions of years increasing and multiplying whenever inclination and circumstances favored such a course. A few nunneries, cloisters and Shaker villages have made ascetic continence a religious rite and a martyrdom, but where are the societies who have tried pure, affectional, loving continence? Where can we find a community of men and women who have only had sexual commerce for purposes of procreation? and where are the generations that have had continent parents, grandparents, and great grandparents? Alas! echo answers where? And till we have just one such, this question will have been experimentally tested on one side only. Men plead for moderate indulgence, (saying that continence will produce a race of apathetic, dull, lifeless, pale, sad-looking people - sexless and soulless.) But how do they know? The few Alphaites who have lived continently speak in eulogies of its effects upon themselves all they know to have tried it. It makes them kind, loving, charitable and unselfish, strong, vigorous and young, even as plants and trees are stronger, more vigorous and long-lived, when not allowed to produce fruit. It is an up-hill work, I will allow, this one of unteaching the old, and ingraining into the mind the new. Women, wine and feastings - next to wars - seemed to be the greatest luxuries of antiquity. Not woman as she should be - man's equal, his helper and his mother; but as his slave, his subject and his plaything - one who ministered unto and gave him pleasure. The Arabian Nights and Shakespeare, and all old-time books, and indeed, all novels, even of today, place this question of sex prominently before us as if it was first and foremost in all hearts. We shall need a newer and cleaner literature ere the world will become pure and clean. But if here and there one is saved; if here and there one ray of truth reaches a single mind, our labor will not be lost, and that this is being accomplished every mail that reaches me bears record. Broken-down and despairing wives, passion and lust-cursed children, and pale, nerveless and debilitated men, all send in sad and bitter testimonies as to the great need of the work Alphaism is endeavoring to do, and now and then comes a glad, jubilant song from a saved soul that cheers and encourages to more and better work in the future, and assures us that all is not seed sown on stony ground. \\\"The time has come to preach soul; No meager shred - the manly whole; Let agitation come; who fears? We need a flood; the filth of years Has gathered round us. Roll then on; What cannot stand had best be gone.\\\" ELMINA D. SLENKER. SNOWVILLE, PULASKI Co., Va."}

One hundred and six abdominal bandages have also been made by this society and have been approved and accepted. It is not generally known that this Association is the only one working under Government direction. No salaries are paid and no expenses incurred.

The ship Relief has been fitted out as a floating hospital, complete in every detail, by the W. N. W.R., the awnings alone costing $1,500. The Mount Vernon branch is working for this great object, and feels that if by their effort even one of the American soldiers or sailors, sick or wounded, can be spared the discomforts of the ordinary hospital transport, its work will be well done; and the public have the great satisfaction of knowing that every cent given to this Association is used for the comfort and benefit of our own brave men.

I left here on Sunday morning in the rain in company with Mr. Wills, Mrs. Morell, Mr. Haskell, Mrs. Alverd, et al, and took train at Morgan Bulley's office, and soon found ourselves at Fairfax. I cannot tell you the scenes which awaited our eyes; the wounded were constantly coming; but no hospitals this time; only God's great one under the blue canopy. The men were brought down from the field and laid on the ground beside the train, and so back up the hill 'till they covered acres. The bales of ahy for forage were broken open and the ground was \"littered\", like \"bedding\" for horses. They came 'till dark and then it was dark indeed: One lantern on the ground; made requisition for candles; drew a few. The wind blew just enough to put them out every few minutes, and the men lay so thick we could not take one step in the dark. [By midnight the men lay so thick we could not take one] By midnight there must have been three thousand helpless men lying in that hay. We had two water buckets - five dippers - the stores which we carried to eat besides hard crackers. My one stew pan which I remembered to take, and this made coffee for them. All night we made compresses and slings and bound up and wet wounds when we could get water, for what we could traveled miles in the dark over those poor help- less wretches, in terror lest some ones candle fall into the hay and consume them all. At length morning came and we sent up the train with 1250. Next 1000, next 1100, next 940 and so on. Still the ambulances came down and the cars went out and we worked on. Took the meat from our own sandwiches and gave it to them, and broke the bread into wine and water to feed the poor sinking wretches as they lay in the ambulances. On Monday the cavalry appeared in the wood opposite and a raid was hourly expected. (Ineglected to tell you that Mrs. Fales sent to me before I started to know if she could go with me. I had the train wait and sent back an ambulance for her and her stores; and this made three ladies --Mrs. Carner is away. On Monday p.m. all the wounded then in were sent off and the danger became so iminent that Mrs. Fales thought it best to leave, al tho she only \"went for stroes\". I begged to be excused from accompanying her as the ambulances were up to the field for more wounded and I knew I should never leave a wounded man there if I knew it, though I were taken prisoner forty times."}

At six o'clock it commenced to thunder and lighten, and all at once the artilery began to play joined by the musketry, about two miles distant. We sat down in our tent and waited to see them break in upon us; but Reno's forces held them back. the old 21st Mass. lay between us and the enemy and they couldn't pass. God only knows who is lost, I do not, for the next day all fell back. Poor Kearney, Stephens and Webster were brought in, and in the p.m. Kearney and Heintalemen's divisions fell back through our camp on their way to Alexandria; we knew this was the last. We put the thousand wounded we had then into the train. I took one car load of them, Mrs. Morell another, the men took to horse. We steamed off and two hours later there was no Fairfax Station. Reached Alexandria at ten o'clock at night, and oh, the repost which met those poor men at the train. The people of the Island are the most noble band I ever saw or heard of. I stood in my car and fed the men 'till they could eat no more, then the people would take us home and feed us and after this we came home. I had slept 1-1/4 hours since Saturday night; but I am well and a strong and wait to go again if I have need. Our forces are all back again in the old places around the city. McClellen's army here again and he in command of it all. I am going to reach for my friends now. I have told you nothing of the old friends who met us among the wounded and dying on that bloody field. I have no heart to tell it today. Two huge boxes from Jersey have arrived. I don't know where we shall need them next. To Archie and Lizzie Shaver, Yours, Clara Barton Frankfort, N.Y. Headquarters Military District of Washington, Washington, D. C., October 23 1862 Miss Clara H Barton I have conferred with Gen. Wadsworth on the subject of obtaining a horse for your use. And he has directed that I place a horse at your disposal as soon as a suitable one can be found. Very respectfully Yr. Obt. Svt. John P. Sherburne Asst.

Dear friends Mr Wells returns tomorrow, and I improve the opportunity to send a line by him to you, not feeling quite certain if posted matter reaches directly when sent from the Army. We reached Aquia Creek safely in the time anticipated, and to my great joy learned immediately that our old friend Capt (Maj.) Hall (of the 21st) was Q. Master as soon as the Boat was unloaded he came on board and spent the remainder of the evening with me. - we had a home chat I assure you - \u2014 remaind till the next day, sent a bbl of apples etc up to the Capt's quarters and proceeded with the remainder of our luggage for which,, it is needless to say; ready transportation"}

Bailey in charge who instituted himself as watch over the goods until he sent them all up to Head Quarters My Ambulance came through that P.M, but for fear it might not, Genl Sturgis had his taken down for me, and had supper arranged and a splendid serenade: I don't know how we could have had a warmer \"welcome home\" as the officers termed it. Head Quarters are in the door yard of a farm house, one room of which is occupied by Miss G. and myself. - My wagons are a little way, from me, out of sight, and I am wishing for a tent and stove to pitch and line near them. - - the weather is cold, and the ground covered with snow, but I could make me comfortable with a good tent, floor and stove, and should prefer it to a room in a rebel house and one so generally occupied. The 21st are a few rods from me, many of the officers call to see me every day. Col Clark is very neighborly, he is looking finely now he was in this PM, and was going in search of Col Morse whom he thought to be a mile or two distant. I learned to night that the 15th are only some three miles away. The 36th I cannot find yet. I have searched hard for them and shall get on track soon I trust. Of Army movements nothing can be said with certainty, no two persons, not even the Genls agree in reference to the Justice programme the snow appears to have deranged the plans very seriously. I have read calls from two Genl. today and in the course of conversation I discovered that their views were entirely different. Genl Burnside stood a long time in front of my door today but to my astonishment, he did not express his opinion. Strange! I have not suffered for want of the boots yet, but should find them convenient I presume, and shall be glad to see them. - the sore finger is much the same, not very troublesome, although somewhat, so"}

Feb. 22nd/63 To the Members of the Military Comtee US.S. Senators Nothing less than a strong conviction of duty owed to one of the brave defenders of our Nation's honor could induce me to intrude for a moment upon the already burdened, and limited term of action yet remaining to your Honorable Body. During the late Battle of Fredericksburg the 21st Massachusetts Regiment of Volunteers were ordered to charge upon a Battery across an open field; in the terrible fire which assailed them, the colors were three times in quick succession bereft of their support; the third time they were seized by Sergeant Thomas Plunkett of Co. E. and borne over some three hundred yards of open space, when a shell from the enemies Battery in its murderous course killed three men of the regiment and shattered both arms,"}

He could no longer support the colors upright. but planting his foot against the staff. he endeavored to hold them up while he strove by his shouts amid the confusion to attract attention to their condition: for some minutes he sustained them against his right arm torn and shattered just below the shoulder, while the blood poured over and among the sacred folds, literally obliterating the stripes, leaving as fit emblem of such heroic sacrifice only the crimson and the stars. Thus drenched in blood and rent by the fury of eight battles. the noble Standard could be no longer borne and while its gallant defender lay suffering in field hospital from amputation of both arms, reverently wrapped by Col Clark and and returned to the State House in Boston. with the request that others might be sent them; the 21st had never lost their colors but they had worn them out, The old flag and its brave bearer are alike past other usefulness, save as examples for emulation, and titles of glory for some bright page of our nations history, and while the one is carefully treasured in the sacred archives of the state, need I more than ask of this noble body to put forth its protecting arm to shelter, cherish and sustain, the other. If guaranty were needful for the private character of so true a soldier, it would have been found in the touching address of his eloquent Colonel (Clark) delivered on Christmas beside the stretcher waiting at the train at Falmouth to carry its [burden] helpless burden to the car, whither he had been escorted not only by his regiment but his General The tears which rolled over the redened cheeks around him were ample testimony of the love and respect he had won from them and today his hearts deepest affections [turns?] around his gallant regiment as the defenders of their [nation] Country.
